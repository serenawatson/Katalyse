# Katalyse
Having chosen the track of communications and connectivity for HackMIT 2020 we decided to design a social media targeted specifically at gamers. 
Having had minimal coding experience, our team decided to focus on the front end UI/UX as that, in our opinion, is the most important aspect of a social media platform.

Included in this repository is the rough copy of our backend website, along with a link to download our interactive deskptop application prototype made using Figma.
