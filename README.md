# Katalyse
Having chosen the track of communications and connectivity for HackMIT 2020 we decided to design a social media targeted specifically at gamers. 
Having had minimal coding experience, our team decided to focus on the front end UI/UX as that, in our opinion, is the most important aspect of a social media platform.

Included in this repository is the rough copy of our backend website, along with an exported version of our interactive Desktop application prototype. The prototype could be downloaded and imported into Figma for a clearer visual of our application interface.
